# Time-Series-Analysis-on-IOT-Dataset
## Dataset
This dataset featuring Consumption of Electrical Blower Machine with timeslots of around 10-15 min. 
This data is recorded with help of IoT device.
Energy Consumption is Measured between Current and Previous time stamp. The above time series consumption is Stationary with time as KWH i.e Kilo Watt/Hour Capacity of Blower motor is fixed.
## Output
Predicted using ARIMA Model after decomposition
